  <h2 id="the-realization">The Realization</h2>

<p>Earlier this year — long before the recent <a href="https://gist.github.com/simi/349d881d16d3d86947945615a47c60ca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ruby Central fiasco</a> — I started exploring ideas for the next major version (4.x) of RubyGems and Bundler. That’s when it struck me: somewhere along the way, these projects stopped moving forward. Formats like <strong>gemspec</strong>, <strong>Gemfile</strong>, and others haven’t evolved in years, and any attempt to change them usually ends in early rejection.</p>

<p>Over time, RubyGems and Bundler became finely tuned for <strong>large company deployments</strong> and <strong>super-stable environments</strong>, but that same stability now limits innovation. The excitement of experimenting, hacking, and building new ideas into Ruby’s tooling slowly faded — at least for me.</p>

<h2 id="the-inspiration">The Inspiration</h2>

<p>While working on some Python projects recently (mostly <a href="https://github.com/apache/airflow" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Airflow</a>-related), I was deeply inspired by <strong><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">uv</a></strong> — its simplicity blew me away. The <code>run</code> command just <em>worked</em>: no confusing errors, no excuses, no manual setup. It installed everything needed — even Python itself — and executed the program at lightning speed.</p>

<p>As a partial web developer, I’ve also long admired how JavaScript projects use the <strong>scripts</strong> section in <code>package.json</code>. It’s such a clean way to define project-specific commands — no more copy-pasting long, platform-specific commands from <code>README</code>s. In Ruby, I often had to scan CI setups to figure out how to run specs (<code>rake</code>, <code>rspec</code>, or another runner), how to run linters, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="the-acceptance">The Acceptance</h2>

<p>In Ruby, there’s no single entry point for this kind of extra project metadata or developer scripts. Yes, there’s <strong>Rake</strong>, but it suffers from the classic chicken-and-egg problem — it often loads the entire app environment just to run a simple command. It <em>can</em> be configured otherwise, but that’s rare in practice. Meanwhile, <code>Gemfile</code> is for dependencies, gemspecs aren’t meant for apps, and trying to push features like “install by default” for <code>bundle exec</code> inside Bundler felt nearly impossible (even though an environment variable for it already exists).</p>

<p>At the same time, I’ve always admired how well RubyGems and Bundler work internally — they’re elegant, consistent, and incredibly stable. But I realized I wanted to <strong>recompose</strong> them: use the same powerful internals in a different way, with a simpler and more modern interface. Looking deeper inside, I had to accept a truth — changing them directly would be nearly impossible. However, building a <strong>custom “frontend” wrapper</strong> that instructs these tools to behave differently <em>was</em> possible.</p>

<p>That’s how the idea for <strong>Ruby Butler</strong> was born. From that point, it began taking shape as a simple command-line tool — the <strong><code>rb</code> command</strong> in your terminal, ready to serve.</p>

<h2 id="the-discovery">The Discovery</h2>

<p>Ruby Butler started as a simple Bash script, just mangling a few environment variables needed by Ruby, RubyGems, and Bundler. To control the Ruby environment, all you really need is to put the desired Ruby’s <code>bin</code> directory in your <code>PATH</code> and set two variables — <code>GEM_HOME</code> (where to install gems) and <code>GEM_PATH</code> (<code>GEM_HOME</code> plus Ruby’s default gems). That’s it. That’s the whole “rocket science” behind tools like <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/blob/a543a35790e5528b5a67de20e78a7390f5f7606e/share/chruby/chruby.sh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">chruby</a>.</p>

<p>Every Ruby environment tool I’d used — <code>chruby</code>, <code>rbenv</code>, and others — was tied tightly to the <strong>shell</strong> (mostly Bash and friends). That worked, but it often caused friction. You had to ensure your current shell instance matched the Ruby setup you wanted. Tools like <code>chruby-auto</code> helped a bit, but switching Rubies in the same shell session remained tricky. And on systems without a preinstalled Ruby — my preferred setup today — simply running <code>ruby</code> failed until everything was manually configured. I wanted something truly unified — cross-shell, cross-platform, and automatic. I wanted something that would automatically prepare the exact Ruby environment I’m looking for.</p>

<p>That’s where today’s <strong>Ruby Butler</strong> architecture was born.</p>

<h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2>

<p>Ruby Butler builds on a simple idea: <strong>Rubies are already on your system — you just need the right one at the right time.</strong><br>
By default, it scans <code>~/.rubies</code> (for compatibility with tools like <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ruby-install</a>) and detects which versions are available. From there, it can automatically select the best Ruby for the current context — or let you decide manually.</p>

<p>But the real goal isn’t just <em>choosing</em> a Ruby version. It’s to <strong>prepare a clean, ephemeral environment</strong> where Ruby programs can run without leaving traces behind. This environment exists only for the duration of the command — no shell pollution, no manual resets. For quick scripts, the latest Ruby works just fine. If a <code>.ruby-version</code> file or a <code>Gemfile</code> with a <code>ruby</code> section is detected, Butler automatically switches to the matching version. And when you need something specific, you can ask explicitly: <code>rb -r 3.4.2</code>.</p>

<p>Everything runs through the <code>exec</code> command — <code>rb exec</code>, or simply <code>rb x</code>. It behaves as expected, with no setup needed unless the environment can’t be inferred. Ruby Butler is also smart enough to use <strong>RubyGems binstubs</strong>, eliminating the need for <code>bundle exec</code> or <code>bin/</code> prefixes. Working in a Rails app? Just run <code>rb x rails s</code>. I’ve been experimenting with a shorter alias, <code>rbx</code>, but haven’t fully settled on it yet.</p>

<p>Butler is also clever enough to <strong>compose your Bundler environment automatically</strong>. It runs <code>bundle check</code> and, if necessary, <code>bundle install</code> — all within its own isolated <code>.rb</code> folder. In practice, this means you can literally clone a project and run <code>rb x rspec</code>, and everything just works (unless, of course, other setup like a database is required).</p>

<h2 id="the-innovation">The Innovation</h2>

<p>And finally, Ruby Butler lets you describe how your project should behave to elevate the overall developer experience. You don’t even have to start from scratch — just run <strong><code>rb init</code></strong>, and Butler will generate a basic <strong><code>rbproject.toml</code></strong> file for you. You can also use alternative names like <strong><code>gem.toml</code></strong>, or the <strong>KDL</strong> variants <code>rbproject.kdl</code> and <code>gem.kdl</code> if you prefer a more structured format.</p>

<p>This marks the beginning of a <strong>new, unified project format for Ruby</strong> — something that could, in time, replace both gemspec and Gemfile. For now, it simply decorates your project with a <strong>name</strong> and a set of <strong>scripts</strong> — commands (optionally with descriptions) that appear as a clean, discoverable list in the CLI via <code>rb run</code>.</p>

<p>And the best part? The Butler <strong>prepares the full environment for you automatically</strong>, just as it does with the <code>exec</code> command. When you run <code>rb run test</code> or <code>rb run lint</code>, Butler silently sets up the correct Ruby, Bundler, and gem context behind the scenes, ensuring everything “just works.” No shell hacks, no manual setup, no guesswork — it’s all part of Butler’s service.</p>

<p>This format is still being explored in collaboration with other modern tools (like <strong><a href="https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">rv</a></strong>) and may grow into a new long-term standard. The goal is simple but ambitious: to make Ruby development feel <strong>effortless, consistent, and joyful again</strong>.</p>

<p>Feel free to try out <strong>Ruby Butler</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/RubyElders/ruby-butler" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">github.com/RubyElders/ruby-butler</a>) — maybe it will serve you well too. Personally, I’ve been using it as my <strong>main Ruby development tool</strong> for the past couple of months across <strong>two systems — Windows and Linux</strong> — with great success. It already runs an extensive integration test suite on both platforms: <a href="https://github.com/RubyElders/ruby-butler/tree/667ca6da75025572d9427be72f4bfae34719f8c9/tests" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Pester</strong> for PowerShell on Windows</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RubyElders/ruby-butler/tree/667ca6da75025572d9427be72f4bfae34719f8c9/spec" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Shellspec</strong> for Bash on Linux</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn’t yet solve every problem I’ve encountered over the years with RubyGems and Bundler, but in my opinion, it’s already a <strong>huge improvement</strong> in everyday developer experience. I’d love to hear your ideas and feedback — on GitHub or anywhere else the Ruby conversation lives.</p>

<p>Since Ruby Butler operates in complete isolation, it <strong>won’t interfere with your existing setup or tools</strong>. Just make sure to add the <code>.rb</code> folder and <code>rbproject.toml</code> (or any of its variants) to your global <code>.gitignore</code> for now.</p>

<p>And one last note: please don’t use it in production yet. Ruby Butler is still <strong>evolving rapidly</strong>, and both its API and CLI flags are subject to change. But if you enjoy experimenting and helping Ruby move forward again — that’s exactly the kind of energy Butler was made to serve.</p>

<p>And have I mentioned it’s implemented in <strong>Rust</strong>? Curious why? I’ll explain that story — and what it enables — in one of the next posts.<br>
And as for whether I’m still happy reusing Bundler and RubyGems after recent events… let’s just say that deserves its own story — coming soon. Time will tell how those tools evolve from here, and I’ll be watching closely.</p>

<h2 id="the-epilogue">The Epilogue</h2>

<p>During Ruby Butler’s early development, I shared early ideas and prototypes with several friends and respected members of the Ruby ecosystem — even before it was public on GitHub. To be transparent, I was also looking for potential <strong>funding or interest</strong> to see whether this kind of work could grow into something more official. I reached out to <strong>Ruby Central</strong>, offering them the opportunity to develop Ruby Butler under their umbrella as an <strong>experimental incubator</strong> — a safe space to test and validate new ideas that could later be <strong>ported or integrated into RubyGems and Bundler</strong> once proven useful.</p>

<p>The response was polite but simple: <em>there’s no interest or funding for this kind of development.</em></p>

<p>More recently, I’ve also submitted a <strong>grant proposal to the <a href="https://www.ruby.or.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ruby Association</a></strong> — also rejected.</p>
